So far, we’ve built the structure of our web page and incorporated interactive visualizations using D3.js to analyze mouse activity and
temperature trends. We made sure to properly process the dataset, separating data for male and female mice while implementing a dropdown
menu that allows users to filter by specific days or weeks. Along the way, we faced some technical challenges, including issues with loading
multiple datasets and ensuring the data was correctly displayed on the charts. After debugging, we fixed these problems by adjusting how the data
was processed and rendered. We also worked on improving the layout, adding clear axis labels, and ensuring that the legend properly distinguishes
between male and female data. The web page is now functional, allowing users to explore how mouse activity and temperature fluctuate over time. We
also refined the design to make the graphs visually appealing and easy to interpret. At this stage, the core functionality is in place, but there’s
still room for improvement.

One of the biggest challenges will be making the visualizations as intuitive and interactive as possible. Right now, the graphs show trends effectively,
but adding features like hover tooltips, zooming, or toggling between different data categories (such as estrus vs. non-estrus periods) will take more effort.
Another difficulty is handling such a large dataset—since we have minute-level data for 14 days, performance optimization will be crucial to keep everything smooth
and responsive. Making sure that users can easily interpret the data without feeling overwhelmed is also a challenge, so we’ll need to focus on thoughtful design choices.
We also want to highlight key insights in a way that feels engaging rather than just displaying raw numbers. Additionally, ensuring that transitions between different time
ranges (days, weeks, or the full dataset) work seamlessly will require careful attention. Finally, we need to refine our explanation of the findings so that even users unfamiliar
with circadian rhythms in mice can understand the patterns we are presenting. Bringing all these elements together in a polished final product will take effort, but it’s an exciting challenge.
