        <h2>Background Information</h2>
        <p>Visualization is based on mouse data covering 2 weeks of minute-level activity and core body temperature. Mice follow a 12-hour light/dark cycle.</p>
        <p>Estrus (a recurring period of sexual receptivity and fertility in many female mammals) occurs every 4 days in females.</p>

        <h2>Motivation</h2>
        <p>This project explores circadian rhythms in mice, with a particular focus on how activity levels and body temperature fluctuate between male and female mice across the estrus and non-estrus phases. By analyzing these differences under a controlled 12-hour light cycle, we can gain insights into how hormonal changes influence biological rhythms. Understanding these patterns has broader implications for sleep, metabolism, and reproductive health research, including potential applications to human chronobiology.</p>

        <h2>Takeaways</h2>
        <p>One of the most striking takeaways is how strongly mice follow their circadian rhythms. The data clearly shows temperature and activity rising and falling in sync with the 12-hour light-dark cycle, reinforcing how deeply biology is wired to external time cues.</p>
        <p>A particularly fascinating finding is how female mice exhibit higher temperatures and increased activity during estrus. This cycle appears consistently in the data, suggesting that hormonal changes play a measurable role in behavior. However, male and female mice do not follow identical patterns—during non-estrus phases, female activity and temperature more closely resemble male patterns, but during estrus, females show notable increases in both.</p>
        <p>Another key observation is that mice, being nocturnal, are most active during the dark phase. While this might seem expected, visualizing the data makes it clear just how precisely their biological clocks operate. Notably, while both sexes are more active at night, the differences between males and females shift depending on estrus vs. non-estrus days, further emphasizing the impact of reproductive cycles on circadian behavior.</p>
        <p></p>

        <h2>Conclusion</h2>
        <p>These patterns aren’t unique to mice—circadian rhythms and hormonal cycles influence behavior, metabolism, and health in nearly all organisms, including humans. This project highlights how tracking physiological patterns across both time and biological sex can reveal deeper insights into the interplay between circadian rhythms, hormones, and behavior.</p>
